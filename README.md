# Soundscape-Project
My soundscape project is a fairly abstract and imaginative representation of what is feels like to be stuck in the cycle of a toxic relationship.
It is also loosely based on the musical inflections in the music of Fantasia, used to represent shifts in emotion and to represent a negative change occuring in the relationship.
My project is meant to begin with a sense of excitement, happiness, and overwhelmingly positive emotions.
Then, as it continues, it is revealed that this intitial sense of happiness was not all it was made out to be.
Combined with orchestral music and common sounds, I wanted to create a sense of anxiety and tension towards the end.
I want listeners to feel the ups and downs of the relationship through the work and to be able to follow the narrative.
